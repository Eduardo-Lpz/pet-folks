# PetFolks

Right now, if we take a little break and go for a walk we'll probably see a cat or a dog laying, walking or looking for food in the street and this is because there are countless stray cats and dogs around the world.

Some of them are lucky to be rescue by an animal shelter or by organizations who try to find a proper home for them.

Having that in mind, this Rails application would try to centralize the information of these shelters to bring a more easy way for a potential adopter to find "the right one".
